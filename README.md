# Singleton - Design Pattern

Singleton is a design pattern that aims to ensure that a given class is instantiated only once, so when accessing the class all users will access the same instance.
To reproduce the use of the Singleton pattern, a simple electronic vehicle braking system was implemented as an example, proposing braking, parking and driving.
